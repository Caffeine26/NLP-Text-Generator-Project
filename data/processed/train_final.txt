emerald triangle skirmish
background
despite repeated skirmishes , the icj reaffirmed its 1962 ruling , confirming cambodian sovereignty over the temple complex . nevertheless , ambiguities in territorial limits and the absence of a mutually agreed border demarcation continued to fuel tension , making the region a recurring flashpoint for military and diplomatic crises between the two nations . analysts emphasize that these disputes are intertwined with domestic politics , historical memory , and the strategic value of the highlands overlooking the khao phra wihan national park and surrounding areas . [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ]
the border dispute between cambodia and thailand originates from ambiguities in the boundary demarcations established under the 1904 and 1907 agreements , which sought to define the frontier between the kingdom of siam ( modern thailand ) and the french third republic in french indochina , which included cambodia . these treaty maps and survey documents produced by french colonial authorities were often imprecise , leading to overlapping claims over several highland areas and strategic passes .
on 7 december 2025 , cambodia and thailand engaged in a 30-minute border skirmish . the following day , thailand carried out ground and f-16 air operations at multiple border locations in cambodia . on 10 december , the royal thai army ( rta ) launched operation sattawa and seized a number of localities in northern cambodia . united states president donald trump urged cambodia and thailand to honour his brokered ceasefire agreement amid the renewed border clashes .
the international community—particularly the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) and the united nations ( un ) —was urged to intervene in mediating the conflict . although tensions gradually subsided under external diplomatic pressure , the july 2025 airstrikes and ground engagements were among the most intense episodes in the cambodia–thailand border dispute since the temple of preah vihear case , leaving a lasting impact on the stability and security of mainland southeast asia .
the situation intensified on 23 july , when a thai soldier was seriously injured after stepping on a pmn-2 anti-personnel landmine in nam yuen district of ubon ratchathani province . the incident triggered hostilities , and the following day , direct armed clashes erupted across several sectors of the frontier . both nations claimed to have acting in self-defence and accused the opposite side of initiating hostilities . more than 200,000 civilians were displaced across northeastern thailand and northern cambodia . the royal thai air force ( rtaf ) deployed general dynamics f-16 fighting falcon fighter jets to conduct airstrikes against cambodian military installations along the border , marking he first time rtaf had entered combat since the thailand–laos border war .
following the clash in the emerald triangle , manet responded by announcing the initiation of proceedings to submit the matter to the icj , while affirming he did not wish for conflict with thailand . [ 49 ] on the thai side , phumtham stated that neither side wished for the situation to escalate further and confirmed that the incident had already been resolved . on 29 may , a meeting was held between general phana khlaeoplotthuk , commander-in-chief of the royal thai army ( rta ) , and general mao sophan , commander-in-chief of the royal cambodian army , to coordinate efforts to reduce tensions and prevent future incidents . [ 54 ]
the dispute remained largely dormant until the late 20th century , when both thai and khmer sentiments intensified the sensitivity over border sovereignty . from 2008 to 2011 , renewed military clashes erupted , including artillery exchanges , patrol skirmishes , and limited incursions , resulting in multiple fatalities and injuries on both sides . these clashes underscored the enduring volatility of the area and the challenge of reconciling historical treaties with contemporary nationalist claims .
