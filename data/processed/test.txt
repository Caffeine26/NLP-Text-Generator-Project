Following Cambodia's independence from France in 1953, the sovereignty of the Preah Vihear temple complex became a focal point of the dispute. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a ruling in 1962 awarding the temple itself to Cambodia, citing historical maps and French survey documentation.[47] However, the court did not clearly delineate the surrounding territory, leaving the adjacent highlands, cliffs, and approaches to the temple in a state of legal and military uncertainty.[48]

On 28 May, Cambodian and Thai soldiers engaged in a brief 10-minute skirmish, resulting in the death of one Cambodian soldier, Second Lieutenant Suon Roun.[29] The skirmish occurred in the Emerald Triangle along the border of Cambodia's Preah Vihear province and Thailand's Ubon Ratchathani province.[55] Both countries claimed each other was the aggressor. Mao Phalla, spokesperson for the Cambodian army, claimed that Thai soldiers were the first to open fire on Cambodian soldiers in a trench that had been in use for a while. Meanwhile, Winthai Suvaree, spokesperson for the Thai army, claimed that Thai soldiers had attempted to persuade the Cambodian soldiers to withdraw before the Cambodians opened fire.[55][56]
