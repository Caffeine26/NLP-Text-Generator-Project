The territorial dispute between Cambodia and Thailand escalated into a direct armed confrontation on 24 July 2025 along the Cambodia–Thailand border. Both countries subsequently agreed to an unconditional ceasefire on 28 July 2025. However, fighting broke out again in December allegedly by Cambodian attack, and Thailand seized several towns alongside the border.
The situation intensified on 23 July, when a Thai soldier was seriously injured after stepping on a PMN-2 anti-personnel landmine in Nam Yuen district of Ubon Ratchathani province. The incident triggered hostilities, and the following day, direct armed clashes erupted across several sectors of the frontier. Both nations claimed to have acting in self-defence and accused the opposite side of initiating hostilities. More than 200,000 civilians were displaced across northeastern Thailand and northern Cambodia. The Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) deployed General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets to conduct airstrikes against Cambodian military installations along the border, marking he first time RTAF had entered combat since the Thailand–Laos border war.
The international community—particularly the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the United Nations (UN)—was urged to intervene in mediating the conflict. Although tensions gradually subsided under external diplomatic pressure, the July 2025 airstrikes and ground engagements were among the most intense episodes in the Cambodia–Thailand border dispute since the Temple of Preah Vihear case, leaving a lasting impact on the stability and security of mainland Southeast Asia.
On 7 December 2025, Cambodia and Thailand engaged in a 30-minute border skirmish. The following day, Thailand carried out ground and F-16 air operations at multiple border locations in Cambodia. On 10 December, the Royal Thai Army (RTA) launched Operation Sattawa and seized a number of localities in northern Cambodia. United States president Donald Trump urged Cambodia and Thailand to honour his brokered ceasefire agreement amid the renewed border clashes.

Temple of Preah Vihear case during hearings at the International Court of Justice in 1961
The border dispute between Cambodia and Thailand originates from ambiguities in the boundary demarcations established under the 1904 and 1907 agreements, which sought to define the frontier between the Kingdom of Siam (modern Thailand) and the French Third Republic in French Indochina, which included Cambodia. These treaty maps and survey documents produced by French colonial authorities were often imprecise, leading to overlapping claims over several highland areas and strategic passes.
Following Cambodia's independence from France in 1953, the sovereignty of the Preah Vihear temple complex became a focal point of the dispute. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a ruling in 1962 awarding the temple itself to Cambodia, citing historical maps and French survey documentation.[47] However, the court did not clearly delineate the surrounding territory, leaving the adjacent highlands, cliffs, and approaches to the temple in a state of legal and military uncertainty.[48]
The dispute remained largely dormant until the late 20th century, when both Thai and Khmer sentiments intensified the sensitivity over border sovereignty. From 2008 to 2011, renewed military clashes erupted, including artillery exchanges, patrol skirmishes, and limited incursions, resulting in multiple fatalities and injuries on both sides. These clashes underscored the enduring volatility of the area and the challenge of reconciling historical treaties with contemporary nationalist claims.
Despite repeated skirmishes, the ICJ reaffirmed its 1962 ruling, confirming Cambodian sovereignty over the temple complex. Nevertheless, ambiguities in territorial limits and the absence of a mutually agreed border demarcation continued to fuel tension, making the region a recurring flashpoint for military and diplomatic crises between the two nations. Analysts emphasize that these disputes are intertwined with domestic politics, historical memory, and the strategic value of the highlands overlooking the Khao Phra Wihan National Park and surrounding areas.[49][50][51]
Prelude
On 13 February 2025, Thai soldiers prevented Cambodian tourists from singing the Cambodian national anthem at the disputed Prasat Ta Muen Thom temple.[52][53] On 28 May, Cambodian and Thai soldiers briefly exchanged fire between each other, resulting in the death of one Cambodian soldier. Attempts to de-escalate failed, with continued tensions leading to border checkpoint closures. Discussions between the Cambodian and Thai militaries were held on 29 May. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet responded to the 28 May incident by seeking a ruling from the ICJ, saying that he did not want to see a conflict with Thailand.[49] Thai defense minister Phumtham Wechayachai said that neither side wanted to escalate the conflict and that it had been resolved.[54]
Emerald Triangle skirmish
On 28 May, Cambodian and Thai soldiers engaged in a brief 10-minute skirmish, resulting in the death of one Cambodian soldier, Second Lieutenant Suon Roun.[29] The skirmish occurred in the Emerald Triangle along the border of Cambodia's Preah Vihear province and Thailand's Ubon Ratchathani province.[55] Both countries claimed each other was the aggressor. Mao Phalla, spokesperson for the Cambodian army, claimed that Thai soldiers were the first to open fire on Cambodian soldiers in a trench that had been in use for a while. Meanwhile, Winthai Suvaree, spokesperson for the Thai army, claimed that Thai soldiers had attempted to persuade the Cambodian soldiers to withdraw before the Cambodians opened fire.[55][56]
Attempts to de-escalate and continued tensions
Following the clash in the Emerald Triangle, Manet responded by announcing the initiation of proceedings to submit the matter to the ICJ, while affirming he did not wish for conflict with Thailand.[49] On the Thai side, Phumtham stated that neither side wished for the situation to escalate further and confirmed that the incident had already been resolved. On 29 May, a meeting was held between General Phana Khlaeoplotthuk, Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army (RTA), and General Mao Sophan, Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Cambodian Army, to coordinate efforts to reduce tensions and prevent future incidents.[54]
Bilateral talks to de-escalate were held on 5 June, but failed to culminate to anything concrete. Phumtham claimed that Cambodia had rejected Thailand's proposals and that, on 7 June, Thailand would reinforce its military presence on the border. Separately on the same date, the Thai army claimed that Cambodian civilians were making frequent incursions into Thai territory and that "these provocations, and the buildup of military forces, indicate a clear intent to use force."[57] On 17 June, Cambodia announced that they have banned the imports of fruits and soap operas from Thailand.[58]
